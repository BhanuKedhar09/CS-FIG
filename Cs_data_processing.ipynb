In this paper, we describe a\\nprobabilistic model of the user annotation process in a social bookmarking\\nsystem del.icio.us.

Flickr offers multiple ways of browsing or\\nsearching it. One option is tag search, which returns all images tagged with a\\nspecific keyword. If the keyword is ambiguous, e.g., ``beetle'' could mean an\\ninsect or a car, tag search results will include many images that are not\\nrelevant to the sense the user had in mind when executing the query.

In this\\npaper frequent patterns are subsets that occur a minimal number of times in a\\nstream of itemsets. However, the discovery of frequent patterns in streams has\\nalways been problematic. Because streams are potentially endless it is in\\nprinciple impossible to say if a pattern is often occurring or not. Furthermore\\nthe number of patterns can be huge and a good overview of the structure of the\\nstream is lost quickly.

In this way the patterns in the\\nclustering will be the largest frequent patterns: maximal frequent patterns.\\n  Our approach to decide if patterns occur often together will be based on a\\nmethod of clustering when only the distance between pairs is known.

We propose a\\nsystematic study of the relations which hold between these properties, as well\\nas complexity results regarding the decision of these properties.

First, instead of maximizing the trace of the\\ncluster crosstable, we propose to maximize a chi-square transformation of this\\ncrosstable. Thus, the trace will not be dominated by the cells with the largest\\ncounts but by the cells with the most non-random observations, taking into\\naccount the marginals. Second, we suggest a probabilistic component in order to\\nbreak ties and to make the matching algorithm truly random on random data. The\\ntruematch algorithm is designed as a building block of the truecluster\\nframework and scales in polynomial time. First simulation results confirm that\\nthe truematch algorithm gives more consistent truecluster results for unequal\\ncluster sizes. Free R software is available.\\n',\n",

Fault classification was accomplished by implementing a series of\\nvirtual sensor models which used data from real sensors (Lam Station sensors,\\nOptical Emission Spectroscopy, and RF Monitoring) to predict recipe setpoints\\nand wafer state characteristics. Fault detection and classification were\\nperformed by comparing predicted recipe and wafer state values with expected\\nvalues. Models utilized include linear PLS, Polynomial PLS, and Neural Network\\nPLS. Prediction of recipe setpoints based upon sensor data provides a\\ncapability for cross-checking that the machine is maintaining the desired\\nsetpoints. Wafer state characteristics such as Line Width Reduction and\\nRemaining Oxide were estimated on-line using these same process sensors (Lam,\\nOES, RFM). Wafer-to-wafer measurement of these characteristics in a production\\nsetting (where typically this information may be only sparsely available, if at\\nall, after batch processing runs with numerous wafers have been completed)\\nwould provide important information to the operator that the process is or is\\nnot producing wafers within acceptable bounds of product quality.

       "  'abstract': \"  We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a Gaussian or binary\\ndistribution in such a way that the resulting undirected graphical model is\\nsparse. Our approach is to solve a maximum likelihood problem with an added\\nl_1-norm penalty term. The problem as formulated is convex but the memory\\nrequirements and complexity of existing interior point methods are prohibitive\\nfor problems with more than tens of nodes. We present two new algorithms for\\nsolving problems with at least a thousand nodes in the Gaussian case. Our first\\nalgorithm uses block coordinate descent, and can be interpreted as recursive\\nl_1-norm penalized regression. Our second algorithm, based on Nesterov's first\\norder method, yields a complexity estimate with a better dependence on problem\\nsize than existing interior point methods. Using a log determinant relaxation\\nof the log partition function (Wainwright & Jordan (2006)), we show that these\\nsame algorithms can be used to solve an approximate sparse maximum likelihood\\nproblem for the binary case. We test our algorithms on synthetic data, as well\\nas on gene expression and senate voting records data.\\n\",\n",

Second, using this compact representation, we solve this\\nproblem as an instance of combinatorial optimization for which we formulate a\\nmixed integer linear program (MILP). The optimal solution of the MILP directly\\nyields an optimal joint-policy for the Dec-Pomdp. Computational experience\\nshows that formulating and solving the MILP requires significantly less time to\\nsolve benchmark Dec-Pomdp problems than existing algorithms. For example, the\\nmulti-agent tiger problem for horizon 4 is solved in 72 secs with the MILP\\nwhereas existing algorithms require several hours to solve it.\\n\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '  Haplotype Inference is a challenging problem in bioinformatics that consists\\nin inferring the basic genetic constitution of diploid organisms on the basis\\nof their genotype. This information allows researchers to perform association\\nstudies for the genetic variants involved in diseases and the individual\\nresponses to therapeutic agents.\\n  A notable approach to the problem is to encode it as a combinatorial problem\\n(under certain hypotheses, such as the pure parsimony criterion) and to solve\\nit using off-the-shelf combinatorial optimization techniques. The main methods\\napplied to Haplotype Inference are either simple greedy heuristic or exact\\nmethods (Integer Linear Programming, Semidefinite Programming, SAT encoding)\\nthat, at present, are adequate only for moderate size instances.\\n  We believe that metaheuristic and hybrid approaches could provide a better\\nscalability. Moreover, metaheuristics can be very easily combined with problem\\nspecific heuristics and they can also be integrated with tree-based search\\ntechniques, thus providing a promising framework for hybrid systems in which a\\ngood trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency can be reached.\\n  In this paper we illustrate a feasibility study of the approach and discuss\\nsome relevant design issues, such as modeling and design of approximate solvers\\nthat combine constructive heuristics, local search-based improvement strategies\\nand learning mechanisms. Besides the relevance of the Haplotype Inference\\nproblem itself, this preliminary analysis is also an interesting case study\\nbecause the formulation of the problem poses some challenges in modeling and\\nhybrid metaheuristic solver design that can be generalized to other problems.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  I postulate that human or other intelligent agents function or should\\nfunction as follows. They store all sensory observations as they come - the\\ndata is holy. At any time, given some agent\\'s current coding capabilities, part\\nof the data is compressible by a short and hopefully fast program / description\\n/ explanation / world model. In the agent\\'s subjective eyes, such data is more\\nregular and more \"beautiful\" than other data. It is well-known that knowledge\\nof regularity and repeatability may improve the agent\\'s ability to plan actions\\nleading to external rewards. In absence of such rewards, however, known beauty\\nis boring. Then \"interestingness\" becomes the first derivative of subjective\\nbeauty: as the learning agent improves its compression algorithm, formerly\\napparently random data parts become subjectively more regular and beautiful.\\nSuch progress in compressibility is measured and maximized by the curiosity\\ndrive: create action sequences that extend the observation history and yield\\npreviously unknown / unpredictable but quickly learnable algorithmic\\nregularity. We discuss how all of the above can be naturally implemented on\\ncomputers, through an extension of passive unsupervised learning to the case of\\nactive data selection: we reward a general reinforcement learner (with access\\nto the adaptive compressor) for actions that improve the subjective\\ncompressibility of the growing data. An unusually large breakthrough in\\ncompressibility deserves the name \"discovery\". The \"creativity\" of artists,\\ndancers, musicians, pure mathematicians can be viewed as a by-product of this\\nprinciple. Several qualitative examples support this hypothesis.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  In this paper we present efficient evaluation algorithms for the Horn\\nTransaction Logic (a generalization of the regular Horn logic programs with\\nstate updates). We present two complementary methods for optimizing the\\nimplementation of Transaction Logic. The first method is based on tabling and\\nwe modified the proof theory to table calls and answers on states (practically,\\nequivalent to dynamic programming). The call-answer table is indexed on the\\ncall and a signature of the state in which the call was made. The answer\\ncolumns contain the answer unification and a signature of the state after the\\ncall was executed. The states are signed efficiently using a technique based on\\ntries and counting. The second method is based on incremental evaluation and it\\napplies when the data oracle contains derived relations. The deletions and\\ninsertions (executed in the transaction oracle) change the state of the\\ndatabase. Using the heuristic of inertia (only a part of the state changes in\\nresponse to elementary updates), most of the time it is cheaper to compute only\\nthe changes in the state than to recompute the entire state from scratch. The\\ntwo methods are complementary by the fact that the first method optimizes the\\nevaluation when a call is repeated in the same state, and the second method\\noptimizes the evaluation of a new state when a call-state pair is not found by\\nthe tabling mechanism (i.e. the first method). The proof theory of Transaction\\nLogic with the application of tabling and incremental evaluation is sound and\\ncomplete with respect to its model theory.\\n',\n",

In this work, two possible enrichments (quantitative\\nand/or qualitative) of linguistic labels are considered and operators\\n(addition, multiplication, division, etc) for dealing with them are proposed\\nand explained. We denote them $qe$-operators, $qe$ standing for\\n\"qualitative-enriched\" operators. These operators can be seen as a direct\\nextension of the classical qualitative operators ($q$-operators) proposed\\nrecently in the Dezert-Smarandache Theory of plausible and paradoxist reasoning\\n(DSmT). $q$-operators are also justified in details in this paper. The\\nquantitative enrichment of linguistic label is a numerical supporting degree in\\n$[0,\\\\infty)$, while the qualitative enrichment takes its values in a finite\\nordered set of linguistic values. Quantitative enrichment is less precise than\\nqualitative enrichment, but it is expected more close with what human experts\\ncan easily provide when expressing linguistic labels with supporting degrees.\\nTwo simple examples are given to show how the fusion of qualitative-enriched\\nbelief assignments can be done.\\n',\n",
